Each Task Folder has the simulation function and a separate project that will create a figure using the function in the folder.

Download each folder and unzip the folder. Have both projects downloaded and opened onto MatLabs.

Run the project that builds the graphs.
Make sure both projects are in the same place so the function can be called on.
